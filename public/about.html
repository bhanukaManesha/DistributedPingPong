    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
            Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.
            (Wikipedia, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong"> Read More..</a> )
    </p>

        <p>
            In this project we try to recreate the pong game from the ealy 70's, as an online multiplayer 2D game.

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Moving to the Current Project Directory</h3>
    <p>
    In-order to create the server we need to first install some dependencies. <br>

    To do that we need to first move to the project directory,<br>

    So we can use the cd command to move to where the <b>server.js</b> file is located. <br>
    
    <pre>
            cd /[path to directory]/ 
    </pre>

    If you have done it correctly, when you enter <b>ls</b> in the console you should see the following; <br>


    
    <pre>
            pc_name:2018Assignment1 user_name$ ls
            node_modules            package-lock.json       package.json            public                  server.js
    </pre>
    
    Hooray!! <br>

    So far you are in the correct directory.<br>
    Next part is a bit tricky. But don't worry, just follow the steps.

    </p>



    <h3>2. Installing the Node Modules</h3>
    <p>
    In order to install the node modules we have to first type in the command;

    <pre>
            npm install
    </pre>

    This will install all the dependencies needed for the program to run.<br>

    After you install all the dependencies, to check whether they have been installed properly, we can use the following commands;<br><br>
    
    To check whether <b>Express</b> is installed properly, we can enter this command,

    <pre>
            npm list express     
    </pre>
    If you have successfully installed it, you should see the output below.
    <pre>
            └── express@4.16.3    
    </pre>

    To check whether <b>Socket.io</b> is installed properly, we can enter this command,

    <pre>
            npm list socket.io   
    </pre>
    If you have successfully installed it, you should see the output below.
    <pre>
            └── socket.io@2.1.1   
    </pre>

    </p>


    <h3>3. Starting the Local Server</h3>
    <p>
    In-order to start the server, we have to just enter one command <br>

    <pre>
            node server.js
    </pre>

    If you have done everything correctly, you should see the following message below.

    <pre>
            Starting server on port 5000
    </pre>
    
    </p>


    <h3>4. Go to the server webpage</h3>
    <p>
    Start the browser and then enter the following address<br>

    <pre>
            http://localhost:5000/
    </pre>

    If you have done everything correctly, you should see the index.html page from the project directory.<br>
    Finally!! <br>
    Just click on the last link to go to the pong.html page, or click <a href="pong.html">here.</a>

    <h2>How to play?</h2>

    <p>
        This game has two versions.
        <ol>
            <li>Single Player</li>
            <li>Multiplayer</li>
        </ol>
        The two sections below show how to play the game.
    </p>

    <h3>Single Player</h3>

    <h5>Objective - The main objective of the game is to reach the game point first (Set to 11 by default).</h5>
    <p>
        <ul>

                <li>To start the single player game the user has to click on the <b>Start button</b></li>
                <li>By default the game will let the user server the ball.</li>
                <li>To start each round the user has to <b>click</b> on the pong table.</li>
                <li>After the ball is being served the CPU will start playing with the user.</li>
        <br>
                <li>The paddle is being divided into <b>five zones</b></li>
                <li>Each zone refelcts the ball in a different pattern</li>

                <img src="img/about/basic.png" height="50%" >


                <li>Below are the different reflection patterns</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>If the ball hits the top 40% it will move towards the top with the <b>same gradient</b>, <br>
                        If it hits the bottom 40% it will move towards the bottom with the <b>same gradient</b>. <br>
                        The speed of the ball <b>does not</b> change.
                    </li>

                    <img src="img/about/top middle.png" height="50%" >

                    <li>If the ball hits the middle 10%, it will move in a <b>random</b> direction out of three directions.<br>
                    They are either going straight or going up and down with the <b>same gradient</b>.<br>
                    The speed of the ball <b>does not</b> change.
                    </li>

                    <img src="img/about/middle.png" height="50%" >

                    <li>If the ball hit the top 5% , it will go up with a <b>higher gradient</b> than the normal gradient of the game,<br>
                        If the ball hit the bottom 5% , it will go down with a <b>higher gradient</b> than the normal gradient of the game,<br>
                        The speed of the ball <b>does</b> change with an increase of 50%.
                    </li>

                    <br>
                    
                    <img src="img/about/top.png" height="50%" >
                </ol>
        </ul>

    <h3>Multiplayer</h3>

    <p>
        To play the multiplayer game there should be two devices. 
        <ol>
            <li>Host Device</li>
            <li>Client Device</li>
        </ol>

        

        <h3>Steps to Setup a Multiplayer Game</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, Both devices should be on the same network</li>

            <li>From the <b>HOST DEVICE</b>, start the local server using the last method in the intallation process and <br>
                go to its localhost address. It will be something like this:</li>

            <pre>
                    http://localhost:5000/pong.html
            </pre>
            <li>Then the <b>CLIENT DEVICE</b> should connect to the IP Address of the <b>HOST DEVICE</b>. If it is on a LAN or WiFi network. It will look something like this:</li>
            <pre>
                    http://192.168.8.101:5000/
            </pre>
            Instead of the IP Address please use the IP Address of the <b>HOST DEVICE</b> in the WiFi Network.
            If the connection is successful, the <b>CLIENT DEVICE</b> should go to the index page of the project.
            <li>Then from the <b>CLIENT DEVICE</b>, click on the last link and go to the pong.html page</li>
            <br>
            <b>Everything is Okay. Both Devices working on the same server.</b>
            <br><br>
            <li>Using the <b>HOST DEVICE</b> click on the Create Game, You will get an autogenerated GameID.</li>
            <li>On the <b>CLIENT DEVICE</b>, Enter the GameID at the text box above the Join Game button and click on the Join Game button</li>
            <br>
            <b>Brilliant!! . Now Both Devices are on the same game. You should see the paddle moving one both the devices when you move it on one device.</b>
            <br><br>
            <li>Finally the <b>HOST DEVICE</b> has to click on the pong table to start serving. <br>
                The user on the <b>HOST DEVICE</b> will be the only person to serve through out the whole game.<br>
                But the serving side changes as in Single Player</li>
        </ol>
